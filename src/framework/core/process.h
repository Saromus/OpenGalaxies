		 * @classname Process
		 * @brief Represents a task, or job that needs to be done over-time.
		 *
		 * Processes are managed by the ProcessManager, which calles the Update() function
		 * of each Process it stores in a round-robin fashion.
		 *
		 * This gives each process a little CPU time. When a Process has completed
		 * its task, it may flag itself to be destroyed on the next Update() by the
		 * ProcessManager.
		 *
		 * Processes can reference Child Processes, that are to be executed next after
		 * this Process is finished executing. Example:
		 * @code
		 *
		 * boost::shared_ptr<WalkProcess> walk = new WalkProcess(object, x, y, z);
		 * boost::shared_ptr<PerformProcess> perform = new PerformProcess(object, PERFORMANCE_TYPE::EMOTE, "yay");
		 * boost::shared_ptr<WaitProcess> wait = new WaitProcess( 3000 );
		 * boost::shared_ptr<WalkProcess> walk2 = new WalkProcess(object, x2, y2, z2);
		 *
		 * walk->SetNext( perform )->SetNext( wait )->SetNext(walk2);
		 * processManager->Attach( walk );
		 * @endcode
		 *
		 * The above example would cause the object to move from point A (x2, y2, z2), to point B (x, y, z), perform an emote, wait 3000 milliseconds,
		 * then return to point A (x2, y2, z2) from point B (x, y, z).
		 *
		 *
		 * @note This class was based off of the CProcess class from "Game Coding Complete: Third Edition" by Mike McShaffry.
		 * @see ProcessManager
